          <p>Elly is an undergraduate student doing computer science at Kenyatta University .
              I'm passionate about technology and the impact it has in our society.
              My love for technology started back in High school and Computer Science is shaping the dream as I had imagined.

              I ventured into building Web Aplications and before developing interest in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
              which I now enjoy since the field falls in my dream career.

              My desire is to grow into a Senior  Software Engineer
